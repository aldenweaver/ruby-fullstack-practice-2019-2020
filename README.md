# ruby-fullstack-practice-2019-2020
Folder containing practice repositories from 2019 &amp; 2020 for full-stack Ruby development. Some projects use Rails, some use Sinatra. Practice with Rake, Rack, APIs, routing, SQL, ORM, CRUD, HTML, data structures, &amp; algorithms.

As of early May 2023, GitHub does not have an option to organize repositories into folders (https://github.com/orgs/community/discussions/4174). Because I had 87 repositories from 2019-2020 for practicing Ruby, I created a new repository to hold them all & made the original ones private to make my GitHub easier to navigate.
